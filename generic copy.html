                    <h2>Physical Symptoms</h2>
                    <p>There are skin lesions that are lighter than normal skin and remain for weeks or months. Leprosy also causes patches of skin with decreased sensation. This makes victims susceptible to hurting themselves because they are unable to
                        detect pain in those regions. Leprosy can also cause eye problems and affect vision. The stereotypical lack of limbs appearance of the victims is actually not caused by leprosy but actually is a side effect of the disease. As victims
                        are unable to sense pain, they are more likely to not notice wounds in their body, which lead to infection and often need for amputation. </p>

                    <h2>Social Symptoms</h2>
                    <p>The social repercussions of leprosy are equally painful. Lepers for centuries have been called the 'untouchables' due to outdated religious and cultural beliefs, as well as misinformation. For one, leprosy was thought to be God's punishment
                        for something the victim did in their previous life. Leprosy was also misidentified as highly infectious, when truly it can only be transmitted through bodily fluids and open wounds. Due to these social misconceptions, lepers were
                        forced to live in slums called 'leprosy colonies.' To make a living and survive, they had to take up jobs such as begging and sanitation working, further making them susceptible to lesions and wounds.</p>
